# LPS-matlab

This code is a MATLAB implementation of **Local Point Signature** for 3D surface shape matching described in our CVPR 2019 paper:

["A Robust Local Spectral Descriptor for Matching Non-Rigid Shapes with Incompatible Shape Structures"](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Wang_A_Robust_Local_Spectral_Descriptor_for_Matching_Non-Rigid_Shapes_With_CVPR_2019_paper.html)

## Usage	  

Please run "demo.m" using MATLAB for generating Local Point Signature(LPS) on Linux, Mac or Windows system.

1. Input: "off", "obj", or "ply" format of mesh model in mesh_dir folder.

2. Output: Local Point Signature on every vertex saved in ourput_dir folder.
